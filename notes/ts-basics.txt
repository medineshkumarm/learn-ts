Type in Ts:
 Easy way to refer to the different properties + functions that a value has
 eg : "red" -> it is a string
            -> it is a value that has all the properties + methods that we assume that a string has
 In simple terms: Every value has a type 

 eg: string : "hi"
     Date : new Date()
     boolean : true 
     Todo : {id: 1, title: good day biscuit , completed: true}

     Types: Primitive
            - number, string , boolean , void , null, undefined, symbol
      and Non-Primitive(Object Types)
            - functions, arrays, classes, objects

Type Inference:
      Ts complier guess the type by itself using var declaration and initialization on the same line
